// Each character in the game has 3 attributes: Health Points, Attack Power and Counter Attack Power.

// Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power.

// For example, if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase the Attack Power by 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on).
// The enemy character only has Counter Attack Power.

// Unlike the player's Attack Points, Counter Attack Power never changes.
// The Health Points, Attack Power and Counter Attack Power of each character must differ.

// No characters in the game can heal or recover Health Points.
